# Game Tutorial Design

## Why Tutorials has bad reputation?

Tutorials are probably one of the most important things in the experience of your game, and guess what... NOBODY CARES!! Well, that's not true at all, there is games like Half life2, Mario, Megman, Spiderman that cares a lot, but we are gonna speak about it later. 

The principal reason why a lot of companies fail desining Tutorials is because their Production Plan is basically centered in other tasks and are not taken into account at How Teach Player. Is soo easy to put a Pop-up that tell player how to play, but not effective at all. So if we put the tutorial design at the beggin of the Gantt Chart, your duties will be think how the level are going to be designed to create a system to teach player without stop the gameplay.

Look at this:

(place picture about game controller)

This Pop-ups or Game Controller schemes can't be in these games! They break the gameplay and stay player immersive away. But obviously there are a lot of games that are allowed to use this resource that are going to be explained later as well.

This happens when developers thinks that it's very hard to find and put every controller and keyboard prompt in his game. But that can frustrate player and it's so important that your game doesn't have this errors, because if player can't continue, you failed as a designer. That's because  I'm gonna give you a totally free pack of prompts assets in the followin [link](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/):

## Teach Gradually Through Experience:
There are several questions that you must be able to answer about every mechanic of your game:
* What am I doing?
* How do I do it?
* Why do I do it?
* When do I do it?
Well, those four questions sound very simple but, there's a lot to explain and the player must think that information about every single action in a few milliseconds.

Let's talk about the learning curve. To teach player your game mechanics it's necessary to situate him in the context, for example if you are going to use the "crouch and shot" connected mechanic in the minute 50, why are you going to show player at the beginning with all the rest of the mechanics? That doesn't make sense, the player will make a mess. So, theach him gradualy, step by step introducin him with no hurries. 

Let's see an example:

(place mega man pictures & explained)

Here, the developers of Mega man...

In conclusion, do not tell the player what to do, teach him a quarter part of the thing, and he himself will discover the rest of the game. He has to learn lots of dynamics for himself, so, give immediate feedback if player has understood it correctly every time. Clear goals are obviously necessary to situate the player in context, no ramblings. Every game has to be interactive, that means learn by playing. As a Chinese philosofer named Confucious said:

“Every truth has four corners: as a teacher I give you one corner, and it is for you to find the other three”.


So, theres a few games that shows how to play, before the game starts! What does it mean? It's basically an interactive main menu and... thats correct! Is an strange way to teach player but, viable. Here is an example:

(place here a picture of Toto Temple Delux, Main menu)

When player has to "dash" or "jump" to acced levels, and this knowledge are gonna be used later to play the game, it's nice because that means player has used and acquired this usable mechanics. This usualy happens in Arcade Games like Toto Temple, the game on the picture, but there's other creative ways to set this in other game genders.

Now almost know how to teach gradually, but what about the "throw experience" term? That's simple, if pop-ups stops the inmersion, we have to teach player by other methods like "learning by example" or showing player involving him with scene elements that show (don't tell) what to do.
