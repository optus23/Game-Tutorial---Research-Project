# Game Tutorial Design

## Why Tutorials has bad reputation?

Tutorials are probably one of the most important things in the experience of your game, and guess what... NOBODY CARES!! Well, that's not true at all, there is games like Half life2, Mario, Megman, Spiderman that cares a lot, but we are gonna speak about it later. 

The principal reason why a lot of companies fail desining Tutorials is because their Production Plan is basically centered in other tasks and are not taken into account at How to Teach Player and at the end, designers don't have time to think and design a good tutorial. Is soo easy to put a Pop-up that tells how to play, but is not effective at all. So if we put the tutorial design at the beggin of the Gantt Chart, your duties will be think how the level are going to be designed to create a system to teach player without stop the gameplay.

Look at this:

This Pop-ups or Game Controller schemes can't be in these games! They break the gameplay and stay player immersive away. But obviously there are a lot of games that are allowed to use this resource that are going to be explained later as well.

This happens when developers thinks that it's very hard to find and put every controller and keyboard prompt in his game. But that can frustrate player and it's so important that your game doesn't have this errors, because if player can't continue, you failed as a designer. That's because  I'm gonna give you a totally free pack of prompts assets in the followin [link](https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/):

## Teach Gradually Through Experience

### Think about the Mechanic
There are several questions that you must be able to answer about every mechanic of your game:
* What am I doing?
* How do I do it?
* Why do I do it?
* When do I do it?
Well, those four questions sound very simple but, there's a lot to explain and the player must think that information about every single action in a few milliseconds.

And you could think, in Chess the player don't has to think faster than the others to win. Yes, but that's not the point. In chess you can prepare the strategy with time, but the basic mechanics of that strategy (Queen movement, Tower movement, etc) have to be thought as faster as you can to resolve it in your mind and improve you strategy.

### Learning Curve
Let's talk about the learning curve. To teach player your game mechanics it's necessary to situate him in the context, for example if you are going to use the "crouch and shot" connected mechanic in the minute 50, why are you going to show player at the beginning with all the rest of the mechanics? That doesn't make sense, the player will make a mess. So, theach him gradualy, step by step introducin him with no hurries. 

Let's see an example:

(place mega man pictures & explained)

Here, the developers of Mega man...

In conclusion, do not tell the player what to do, teach him a quarter part of the thing, and he himself will discover the rest of the game. He has to learn lots of dynamics for himself, so, give immediate feedback if player has understood it correctly every time. Clear goals are obviously necessary to situate the player in context, no ramblings. Every game has to be interactive, that means learn by playing. As a Chinese philosofer named Confucious said:

“Every truth has four corners: as a teacher I give you one corner, and it is for you to find the other three”.


So, theres a few games that shows how to play, before the game starts! What does it mean? It's basically an interactive main menu and... thats correct! Is an strange way to teach player but, viable. Here is an example:

(place here a picture of Toto Temple Delux, Main menu)

When player has to "dash" or "jump" to acced levels, and this knowledge are gonna be used later to play the game, it's nice because that means player has used and acquired this usable mechanics. This usualy happens in Arcade Games like Toto Temple, the game on the picture, but there's other creative ways to set this in other game genders.

### Game Experience
Now we almost know how to teach gradually, but what about the "throw experience" term? That's simple, if pop-ups stops the inmersion, we have to teach player by other methods like "learning by example" or teach player involving him with scene elements that show (don't tell) what to do. Now, we are going to see a curous example about to games that pretend to teach exacty the same thing but with differents methods:

(place a gif showing Dead Space mechanic)

As you see, in Dead Space, your character has to dismember the enemies shooting them right in ahead. How do you theach the player this mechanic? Well, if you don't have time to think a creative way to teach player what to do, you just gonna put some text in a wall to tell (don't show) player: "Cut off yout limbs" on a white board, followed by a pop-up that tells you how to cut off their limbs, followed by audio log that basically tells you the same thing, folowed by another audio log that tells you the exact same thing and FINALLY a Pop-up called "dismemberment" that... tells you the same thing! Thats Horrible. I mean, put some blood text in the wall giving you some hints is it okay, buy spam information about the exactlly same thing its awkward.

The thing is that a few years later, 4 years to be right, a little game come out called Half Life2, that did the exact same thing, and the first thing they do is put an image in your mind of a dimembered body by showing you this:

(place Half Life 2 gif dismembered body)

And when you try to keep moving, you see a table stopping your path, so, you jump on it and... 2 saw blades appear in you perspective vision. So, when you pick up one of them, instantly a zombi appears in your first view, and your first reaction is to press the fire button, so you shoot zombie and see what effective this is. THATS a good Tutorial Design, Valve teach player without pop-us, audios, wall text, and the most important is that they do it in a half time that Dead Space do.

There is more examples about the good Design showed gradually by experience of Half Life 2:

(place birds)
(place barrles)

In all thouse cases the game could told player: "Be carefull with this enemies, or combine explosive barrels with this enemiy to make'em explode" but, no, the conclusion is don't trate your players like morons.

### Execice 1

Let's do an easy exercise to beef up what we learned. Imagine that the video below is the beginin cinematic of a game, describe how and what uses to teach player what is happening, and define the consequences of it. Is a good game tutorial design?

Answer: In fact, yes is a good introduction design. The video show player one simple but pillar thing thowgh experience, what is gonna happen if the protagonists do the same error as the actually infected guy. So starting from this, the protagonists adquire de dynamic of dancing to pretend beeing infeted to avoid dancing zombies.
